# Pingora quick start, but it's a code along

The source code for this repository can be found [here][1].

If you are not already reading this page as a book, it can be found [here][2]

This training is broken up into multiple steps and it is based entirely on the [pingora quick start guide][3].

There are some small changes to the guide, but this is to enable the code along style and only to implement as much as is needed at each step.

## Stuck? 

Everything you need should be documented in each step. If you get stuck, full working examples are available in the github repo [here][1].
